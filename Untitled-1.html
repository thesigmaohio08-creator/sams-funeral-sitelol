                    Friends, classmates, and fellow sufferers of the syllabus. We are gathered here today not to celebrate a life, but to lament a final grade. A number so profoundly tragic, so mathematically insufficient, so utterly devoid of redemptive qualities, that it feels less like a score and more like a cruel judgment handed down by the very gods of cellular respiration, genetic recombination, and the terrifying intricacies of the Golgi apparatus: **66**.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sam was a visionary. He had dreams of optional attendance and minimal required reading. He believed in the human spirit and, perhaps more tragically, in his ability to guess "C" for three questions in a row and succeed. He was, in a word, ambitious. He envisioned a world where understanding the Krebs cycle was merely a suggestion, not a prerequisite for passing. A world where osmosis was a general concept, not a process requiring meticulous diagramming. Alas, such a world remains but a distant dream.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But the Bio Test, that relentless gatekeeper of academic viability, cared not for ambition. It demanded knowledge of mitochondria and their powerhouse capabilities, the intricate dance of mitosis, the bewildering pathways of photosynthesis—terms Sam had only ever associated with aggressive napping during lectures or the faint whispers of more diligent classmates. He studied, yes. He held the textbook, yes. He even, on one memorable occasion, opened it. But like a ship sailing into a black hole, the knowledge simply failed to make it to its intended destination—his long-term memory, or even his short-term scratch pad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The grade of 66 is a painful reminder of the fragile balance between passing and academic probation. It is a number that haunts the dreams of every B-student, a chilling premonition for those who flirt with the D-range. We look at this result, and we weep. We weep for the late nights that should have been spent deciphering anatomical diagrams, but were instead spent perfecting his highly scientific and peer-reviewed tier list of fast-food mascots. We weep for the glorious potential that was snuffed out by a poorly drawn diagram of a plant cell and an inability to differentiate between prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We remember Sam’s unwavering optimism, even in the face of daunting chapters on molecular biology. His infectious belief that somehow, through sheer force of will, the correct answers would simply manifest on his answer sheet. This faith, while admirable, proved to be biologically unsound. His notes, a tapestry of doodles and existential questions about the meaning of chlorophyll, now stand as a testament to a spirit too free for the rigid confines of cellular biology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And so, Sam, as you venture into the eternal, where there are no pop quizzes, no mandatory lab reports, and the only metabolism is the one required to digest endless pizza and perhaps a celestial cheeseburger, may you truly **REST IN PIECE**. May the curve of the next class—whatever cosmic curriculum awaits—be ever in your favor. May your future endeavors never again hinge on your recall of protein synthesis. And may your friends never, ever let you forget this monumental, yet hilariously catastrophic, academic failure. Farewell, dear Sam. May your spirit find peace, even if your transcript did not. Amen.
